# 🧠 Expert System for Animal Species Classification

This project is an **expert system** developed in **Java** using the **Rules** library, designed to classify animal species based on their **taxonomic information**. It applies the **forward chaining** technique from artificial intelligence to infer an organism's species from hierarchical biological data.

Developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence course.

## 📌 Main Features

- Identification of species based on taxonomic levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.
- Uses forward chaining inference to deduce conclusions from biological facts.
- Contains structured taxonomic data from multiple amphibians.
- Graphical user interface to enter observations and view classification.
- Rules-based logic engine using the `rules` Java library.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Simulate expert reasoning using a forward chaining algorithm.
- Classify species through comparison of morphological and biological traits.
- Apply artificial intelligence concepts in a real-world biological context.
- Demonstrate the usefulness of taxonomy in intelligent decision-making systems.
